Welcome to FreeCodeCamp Projects!

Note: This project is a complete implementation of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. If you're considering completing FreeCodeCamp's projects, it's advisable to tackle them on your own. Working through the projects independently allows for a deeper understanding of the concepts, fosters problem-solving skills, and aids in memory retention. While this project serves as a reference, the true value lies in the learning journey and the hands-on experience gained from building projects from scratch.

FreeCodeCamp is an open-source community that offers a comprehensive curriculum for learning web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of my journey to Learn and implement Python programming through FreeCodeCamp.

**Project List:**

    Project 1: Build an Arithmetic Formatter Project - COMPLETED
        Description: A Python program that takes in arithmetic problems as strings and formats them neatly for display, including alignment and calculation of results.

    Project 2: Build a Time Calculator Project - NOT COMPLETED
        Description: This project involves creating a Python script that calculates the sum of time durations and provides the result in hours and minutes.

    Project 3: Build a Budget App Project - NOT COMPLETED
        Description: An application built with Python for managing personal finances, including features for budget tracking and expense categorization.

    Project 4: Build a Polygon Area Calculator Project - NOT COMPLETED
        Description: A Python program that calculates the area of various polygons based on user input, utilizing mathematical formulas for different shapes.

    Project 5: Build a Probability Calculator Project - NOT COMPLETED
        Description: This project involves writing a Python script that simulates random events and calculates probabilities based on specified conditions.

Each project showcases my skills and understanding of Python programming concepts, from basic syntax to more advanced topics like data analysis and web development. Feel free to explore the repositories and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
